<h1> AlphaCronke </h1>

<p>
    <a href="http://alphacronke.goatstone.com" target="new">http://alphacronke.goatstone.com</a>
</p>

<p>

    The web application "AlphaCronke" consists of the text from the story:
    <b>"Dickory Cronke, The Dumb Philosopher, or, Great Britain's Wonder"</b>
    by Daniel Defoe as well as an Alphabet Range selector.
</p>

<p>
    The text itself comes from the Project Guttenberg collection.
    (&NoBreak;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2051/2051-h/2051-h.htm" target="new2">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2051/2051-h/2051-h.htm</a>&NoBreak;)
</p>

<p>

    The Alphabet Range selector widget enables the selection of a letter or a range of letters.
    This range of letters is then used to select words from the text "Dickory Cronke".

    The selected words are displayed in a different color than the words that do not
    contain that letter.

<p>
    In this way the user is able to view the text and read it in a different way.

<p>
    Perhaps the reader will find insight into the text in this way,
    perhaps it will only be a distraction.
    This is an experiment in text as data.
    The point of this experiment is to see if "data", presented in
    an un-traditional way will help a user gain further insight into the data.
    I do not know if this application is successful beyond being an experiment,
    only you will be able to decide this.


<p>
    The site is done with JavaScript and a library called D3js.
    (&NoBreak;<a href="http://d3js.org/" target="new2">http://d3js.org/</a>&NoBreak;).

    This library is for visualizing data. Here, I am also using it to create UI widgets.
    D3 is an excellent tool and it can be used to create any type of web offering,
    however it specializes in transforming data into data visualizations.

    The complete code can be found on
